The color of the background is light tan, which gives the icon a warm and natural feel; a feel that is in accordance with the cozy and nostalgic aesthetic of the Studio Ghibli films. This minimalistic design reflects the inviting character of Whispers of Ghibli that silently welcomes every visitor through the browser tab with a little bit of magic. |   Whispers of Ghibli is a very emotional and sincere trip to the dream-like realm of the Studio Ghibli—where art, imagination, and feelings come together to create storytelling that will never be forgotten. This site is dedicated to the most famous characters and movies of the studio, the gentle spirit of Totoro to the amazing adventures of Chihiro and Howl. Every part of this website leads you to the repeat of wonders and the warmth that make Ghibli's creations still loved after so long. However, Whispers of Ghibli also goes on to explore the people and passion that were behind the masterpieces, not just through the screen. You will get to know the great artists who drew these fantasy worlds, the creative procedure that changed the hand-drawn magic to life, and lastly, go through an interactive area inspired by the studio's charm that will bring you a little bit of play. Just like that, the whispers lead you through a very special place where each and every frame is full of stories. |
